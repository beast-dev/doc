## What is BEAST?

BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences using MCMC. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. We include a simple to use user-interface program for setting up standard analyses and a suit of programs for analysing the results. 

This website is for BEAST X v10.X (currently version `v{{ site.beast_version }}`). For details about BEAST2, an independent project led by the University of Auckland, [please look here](http://beast2.org).

### Introductory Tutorials

As [an introduction to using BEAST we provide some basic introductory tutorials](/getting_started) using the graphical applications of BEAST to perform analyses using provided example files. 

### Citing BEAST

> The recommended citation for this program is:
> : Suchard MA, Lemey P, Baele G, Ayres DL, Drummond AJ & Rambaut A (2018) Bayesian phylogenetic and phylodynamic data integration using BEAST 1.10 *Virus Evolution* **4**, vey016. [DOI:10.1093/ve/vey016](https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vey016)

#### BEAST is descended from earlier work:

Drummond AJ, Nicholls GK, Rodrigo AG & Solomon W (2002) Estimating mutation parameters, population history and genealogy simultaneously from temporally spaced sequence data. *Genetics*, **161**, 1307-1320.

Rambaut A (2000) Estimating the rate of molecular evolution: incorporating non-contemporaneous sequences into maximum likelihood phylogenies. *Bioinformatics*, **16**, 395-399.

Pybus OG & Rambaut A (2002) GENIE: estimating demographic history from molecular phylogenies. *Bioinformatics*, **18**, 1404-1405.

**BEAST is built on a large body of prior work and appropriate citations for individual modules, models and components will be listed when BEAST is run.**
