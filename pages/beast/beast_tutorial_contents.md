## Introductory tutorials

To help you get started with BEAST and get familiar with the different components and the work-flow we have put together a series of introductory tutorials that you can work through.

[First Tutorial](first_tutorial)
: An introductory tutorial about running BEAST.

[Second Tutorial](second_tutorial)
: An introductory tutorial about interpreting BEAST output.

[Estimating Rates and Dates](rates_and_dates)
: A basic tutorial on inferring rates and dates from tip-dated virus data.

[Using TempEst for data exploration](tempest_tutorial)
: This tutorial describes the use of TempEst to examine the temporal signal of a data set and to look for problematic or erroneous sequences.

## Tutorials for particular types of analyses

[The evolutionary dynamics of a influenza epidemic](phylodynamics_of_epidemic_influenza)
: An introduction to phylodynamic analysis using the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.

[Revealing the fluctuating evolutionary dynamics of seasonal influenza](phylodynamics_of_seasonal_influenza)
: The phylodynamics of seasonal H3N2 over several seasons using the Skygrid demographic model.

## How-tos

We also provide a number of stand-alone 'how-to' documents which describe the procedures for specific analyses, data types, or models in greater detail.

[Creating taxon sets](taxon_sets)
: How to create a taxon set in BEAUti.

[Setting tip dates](tip_dates)
: How to use BEAUti's options to conveniently set the dates of sequences.

[Analysing BEAST output](analysing_beast_output)
: How to analyse the output of BEAST in Tracer

[Sampling the dates of tips](tip_date_sampling)
: How to sample uncertainty in the dates of sequences.

[Fixed local clocks](fixed_local_clocks)
: How to set up the local clock model where different clades have different rates of evolution.

[Custom substitution models](custom_substitution_models)
: How to set up a range of nucleotide substitution models that are not amongst the pre-set choices.

## Advanced Tutorials

These tutorials tackle a range of advanced, technical, topics. They usually involve editing the BEAST XML configuration files.

[Hierarchical Phylogenetic Models](hierarchical_models)

[Markov Jumps and Rewards](markov_jumps_rewards)

[Epoch Models](epoch_tutorial)

[Adaptive MCMC](adaptive_mcmc_tutorial)

[Model Selection](model_selection_1)

[Model Selection --- Advanced](model_selection_2)

[Incorporating travel history](travel_history)

[Analysing datasets with tens of thousands of taxa](thorney_beast)
