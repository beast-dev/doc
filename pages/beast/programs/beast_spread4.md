## SPREAD 4

SPREAD 4 (Spatial Phylogenetic Reconstruction of Evolutionary Dynamics version 4) is a major update to [SPREAD](spread) and [SpreaD3](spread3) and constitutes a package for analysis and visualisation of pathogen pylodynamic reconstructions.

### Using SPREAD 4

SPREAD 4 is compatible with popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and can be accessed directly here: [https://spreadviz.org/](https://spreadviz.org/)

There is no need to install anything, and you only need either a Google account or an e-mail address (and an internet connection) to make use of SPREAD4, which runs entirely online.
SPREAD 4 is essentially an overhaul of SpreaD3 to ensure easily shareable visualisations and continued support in commonly-used browser platforms.

Featuring account-based storage and easy sharing of visualisations by means of unique web addresses, SPREAD 4 is very similar in use as SpreaD3; a tutorial on how to use SpreaD3 is available here: [https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/software/SpreaD3_tutorial](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/software/SpreaD3_tutorial)
