### We are pleased to announce the release of BEAST v1.10 ### 

`BEAST v1.10.0` is a major new version with many new features which focus on flexibility of model specification, 
integration of different data sources, and increasing the speed and efficiency of sampling.

The new version coincides with the publication of a paper describing many of the new features:
