### We are pleased to announce the release of BEAST X (v10.5.0-beta1)

{% include icon-callout.html file='icons/beastx-icon.png' content='BEAST X is the new name for BEAST v1 project and the first release version of this is <code>v10.5.0</code> which supersedes <code>v1.10.4</code> in the old version system. From now on we will use the full major, minor, bugfix style of semantic versioning. Thus, this version is not BEAST 10 but <code>BEAST X v10.5</code> (the 10th major, 5th minor release of the original BEAST project).' %}
