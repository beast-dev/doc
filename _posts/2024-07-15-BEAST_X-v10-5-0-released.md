### We are pleased to announce the release of BEAST X (v10.5.0) ###

BEAST X is the new name for BEAST v1 project and the first release version of this is `v10.5.0` which supercedes `v1.10.4` in the old version system. From now on we will use the full major, minor, bugfix style of symantic versioning. Thus, this version is not BEAST 10 but BEAST X v10.5 (the 10th major, 5th minor release of the original BEAST project).
